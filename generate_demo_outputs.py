SAMPLE_REPORT = """## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

NovaTech Solutions FY2024 shows a total net variance of -$142K (-0.6%) against budget, 
masking meaningful divergences at the account level. Revenue underperformed budget by 2.0% 
(-$286K), driven primarily by a confirmed SaaS revenue miss in Q3 (July–August) following 
a strategic customer churn event. Partially offsetting, Professional Services Revenue beat 
plan by 27.3% in Q4 as backlog implementations completed ahead of schedule. On the expense 
side, Marketing overspent by $155K in Q3 (consistent with the planned NovaSummit brand 
campaign), Cloud Infrastructure costs exceeded budget by $85K in Q4 (linked to an 
architecture migration), and Legal fees spiked 66% in November due to strategic contract 
renegotiations. Five items warrant immediate CFO attention.

---

## DRIVER ATTRIBUTION

**1. Legal & Professional Fees — G&A — November 2024**
- Variance: +$81K (+66.3%) — CRITICAL — OVER_BUDGET
- Driver: Strategic partner contract renegotiation requiring external counsel engagement.  
  Per the budget assumptions, legal spikes of 50–100% are explicitly noted as possible  
  due to board-directed or contract-related activity. This is categorized as UNEXPECTED  
  in timing but not in nature.
- Status: Requires CFO sign-off; check whether retainer scope has expanded.

**2. Travel & Entertainment — Sales — April 2024**
- Variance: +$53K (+50.7%) — CRITICAL — OVER_BUDGET
- Driver: Annual Sales Kickoff (SKO) held April 8–10 in Las Vegas. Per the seasonality  
  calendar, April T&E variances of +50–60% for the Sales department are explicitly  
  budgeted. This variance is EXPECTED and consistent with plan.
- Status: No action required. Close monitoring of T&E normalization in May confirmed.

**3. Marketing & Advertising — Marketing — July 2024**
- Variance: +$155K (+41.8%) — CRITICAL — OVER_BUDGET
- Driver: Q3 brand awareness campaign launch and NovaSummit 2024 user conference  
  preparation. Budget assumptions explicitly state Q3 marketing is front-loaded for  
  the annual conference; variances up to +40% are planned. July came in at +41.8%,  
  slightly above the +40% guidance — the excess $3K warrants a brief note but is  
  not material.
- Status: EXPECTED per plan. Conference spend should normalize sharply in October.

**4. Product Revenue (SaaS) — Sales — July & August 2024**
- Variance: -$178K (-20.2% and -23.4%) — HIGH — MISS
- Driver: Confirmed churn of a financial services customer representing ~$420K ARR  
  following an M&A event at the customer (flagged in company overview Q3 business events).  
  Revenue recognition ceased in July; the miss persists through Q3 before partially  
  recovering as new logos ramp.
- Status: UNEXPECTED churn event (M&A-driven, not performance-related). Forecast  
  has been revised to reflect a -5% headwind on 4001 for remainder of year.

**5. Cloud Infrastructure — Engineering — October & November 2024**
- Variance: +$47K (+32.1%) and +$44K (+30.5%) — CRITICAL — OVER_BUDGET
- Driver: Architecture migration (batch processing change) in September triggered  
  unexpected compute auto-scaling in Q4. Per the company overview, an infrastructure  
  incident in October/November is explicitly documented as a known event.
- Status: Engineering team has since implemented reserved instance changes. Expect  
  normalization in December.

**6. Professional Services Revenue — Sales — October 2024**
- Variance: +$52K (+27.3%) — HIGH — BEAT
- Driver: Q3 implementations completing ahead of schedule, pulling milestone revenue  
  recognition into October. Directly tied to the Enterprise logo onboarding backlog  
  noted in Q3 business events. High-quality favorable variance.
- Status: Positive. Validate with CS team that remaining milestones are on track for Q4.

## RISK FLAGS

1. **SaaS Revenue Headwind Persists:** The Q3 churn event reduces ARR by ~$420K  
   annualized. Unless offset by new logo closings in Q4, full-year SaaS revenue  
   will likely end 3–5% below budget. CRO should provide updated Q4 pipeline confidence  
   by mid-November.

2. **Infrastructure Cost Baseline Has Shifted:** The October/November cloud overruns  
   suggest the prior budget infrastructure cost model may be understated. FY2025  
   budget should reflect the new compute baseline post-migration, not the legacy rate.

3. **Legal Retainer Scope Creep:** A second significant legal spike in the same fiscal  
   year (Q4 2023 + November 2024) suggests the base legal retainer budget may be  
   structurally low. Consider increasing the FY2025 legal budget by $15–20K/month  
   or establishing a $50K contingency reserve.

4. **Full-Year Forecast at Risk:** Forecast vs. budget is -1.4%. Combined with the  
   confirmed SaaS revenue miss and elevated Q4 infrastructure costs, operating margin  
   will likely end below the -3% target. Recommend updated Q4 scenario modeling  
   before board presentation.

5. **Sales Capacity Risk:** The Sales Kickoff investment in April and two new rep  
   hires in May are trailing indicators. If Q4 pipeline coverage is insufficient  
   (<3x quota), FY2025 H1 revenue is at risk.

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **CFO Review (This Week):** Obtain invoice detail for November legal fees.  
   Determine if the strategic partner renegotiation has a defined scope end-date  
   or if additional engagement is expected in December/Q1.

2. **Revenue Bridge to Board:** Prepare a one-page ARR bridge for the Q3 board  
   package showing: opening ARR → new logos → expansion → churn (with M&A attribution)  
   → closing ARR. Contextualize the SaaS miss as a non-recurring churn event.

3. **Infrastructure Cost Review (Engineering/Finance):** Engineering to provide a  
   post-migration infrastructure cost run-rate estimate for December and FY2025  
   planning. Reserve 12% of SaaS revenue (vs. current 11%) as the infrastructure  
   cost model for FY2025 budgeting.

4. **Q4 Reforecast:** Given 3 material variances with forecast implications (SaaS  
   revenue, infrastructure, legal), issue a revised full-year forecast by November 15  
   before the board package is due.
